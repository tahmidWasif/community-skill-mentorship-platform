Project Idea: This platform connects individuals within a community to share and learn new skills through mentorship. Users can register as mentors to offer guidance in various fields, such as coding, cooking, music, or home repairs, while others can sign up as learners. The platform will facilitate one-on-one mentorship sessions, group workshops, and community-driven learning events. By fostering skill-sharing and collaboration, this initiative strengthens community ties and empowers individuals with valuable knowledge. Key features include mentor and learner profiles, scheduling tools, feedback and rating systems, and virtual or in-person meeting options.
